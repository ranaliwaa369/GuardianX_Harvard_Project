# GuardianX Harvard Project

### Lexicographic Decision Framework (LDF)
**A Research Model for Space and Environmental Safety**

---

#### 🧠 Author
**Rana Al Dahlake**  
Founder of **GuardianX Research Initiative**

#### 🎯 Project Overview
This project presents the *Lexicographic Decision Framework (LDF)* — a structured AI-based model designed to optimize **safety, resource allocation, and environmental decision-making** in both **space** and **Earth-based** environments.

The LDF model aims to:
- Formalize explainable AI decision-making logic.  
- Optimize safety and resource allocation under uncertainty.  
- Validate results on space and environmental safety simulations.  
- Produce reproducible, open experimental pipelines for research and collaboration.
